## Overview {.smaller}

```{r setup, echo=FALSE, warnings = FALSE, message = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

This app (<https://porcudighel.shinyapps.io/DDP_Final_App/>) aims at showing how inclusion and exclusion of regressors impacts the final prediction.

The dataset *airquality* has been used to fit *Ozone* against *Solar.R*, *Temp* and *Wind*, which the user can chose via checkboxs.

The user ticks one or more of the checkboxes and presses the button **Submit**.

The resulting formula, plot, R squared and table of coefficients are displayed.

## How it works (processing) {.smaller}

The input checkboxes are used to build up a string containing a formula (no selection leads to main panel with only titles by using of *req(isThruthy(...))* in the code).

, the formula is:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
input_solR_ch <- TRUE
input_temp_ch <- FALSE
input_wind_ch <- TRUE
```

```{r}
params <- NULL
    if (input_solR_ch){params <- c(params,"Solar.R")}
    if (input_temp_ch){params <- c(params,"Temp")}
    if (input_wind_ch){params <- c(params,"Wind")}
    form_mod <- paste0("Ozone ~ ",paste(params, collapse = " + "))
```

The linear regression is executed and predicted data calculated:

```{r}
model <- lm(form_mod, data = airquality)
pred_data <- predict(model, airquality)
```

## How it works (output) {.smaller}

For instance, if "Solar radiation" and "Wind" are ticked the app will display:

```{r}
## Built model
form_mod
# Resulting R squared
round(summary(model)$r.squared,5)
# Model's coefficients
summary(model)$coefficients
```

## How it works (output) {.smaller}

```{r}
## Plot of original and predicted values
with(airquality, plot(Solar.R, Ozone, col = "blue", lwd =2,
                          xlab = "Solar radiation", ylab = "Ozone"))
    with(airquality, points(Solar.R, pred_data, col = "red", lwd =2))
    legend("topleft", c("Original", "Predicted"), pch = 16, 
    col = c("blue", "red"), cex = 1.2)
```

**Possible further improvements**

1.  Possibility to add interaction terms in the building up of the formula.

2.  Choice to include or exclude the variables *Month* and *Day* (as regressors or as grouping variables).

3.  Output plot with choice of variable on the x axis.

4.  Use of a 3D plot when needed.
